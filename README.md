# AutoshopDatabaseProject
A database and a proof of concept for an auto-shop

This Project demonstrates mine and my team's knowledge and mastery with the MySql language. This project utilizes more than 30 tables, more than 50 business rules, approximately 1000 insert statements, views, triggers, and complex query statements and their corresponding outputs.

Our Job for this project was to follow a list of complex business rules that are listed in the file appropriately named BusinessRules.pdf

For this project we used MySql 8.0 and Db4Free.net as the Host of our database server.
